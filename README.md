# Tranquility.nvim

A collection of quiet dark colorschemes for Neovim.

## Philosophy

I find that most color schemes emphasize the reserved words in a language by giving them bright colours. Tranquility.nvim does the opposite, and emphasizes identifiers instead. After all, thatâ€™s what the code is really about, right?

It provides a collection of colorschemes derived from different well-known palettes, because sometimes it's nice to mix things up, without sacrificing any principles.

## Configuration

Install the plugin with your favorite plugin manager, for instance with Lazy:

```lua
return {
    'jqno/tranquility.nvim',

    config = function()
        vim.cmd.colorscheme('tranquility')

        -- Or pick another scheme:
        -- vim.cmd.colorscheme('tranquil-nord')
        -- vim.cmd.colorscheme('tranquil-catppuccin')
        -- vim.cmd.colorscheme('tranquil-intellij')

        -- Or let Neovim pick one at random:
        -- vim.cmd.colorscheme('tranquil-random')
    end
}
```

## Inspiration

I first got the idea watching a talk by [Venkat Subramaniam](https://twitter.com/venkat_s), who uses a similar colorscheme in his editor.

Then I found a few colorschemes, like [zenbones.nvim](https://github.com/mcchrish/zenbones.nvim), which offer different colorschemes following a specific philosophy but based on different well-known color palettes.

This colorscheme is written in the Lua programming language, whose name means 'moon' in Portuguese, and the first implemented palette was the [Selenized palette](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized), whose name also refers to the moon. To stick with this lunar theme, the name of this colorscheme is inspired by the moon as well: it refers to the Sea of Tranquility, which loops back nicely to the quiet philosophy.
